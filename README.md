This project is a Python-based audio recorder application with silence detection and pause/resume functionality. It uses PyAudio for audio recording, Tkinter for the graphical user interface, and NumPy for audio processing. The recorder automatically saves the recording when silence is detected for a specified duration, making it convenient for capturing multiple segments of audio efficiently.
